This must include verifying renderer/tone-mapping exposure in `frontend/src/game/GameView.tsx`, verifying lighting/material visibility in `frontend/src/game/World/FacilityWorld.tsx`, and ensuring UI overlays (hood vignette and fade-to-black) do not fully obscure the scene unless explicitly triggered.",
