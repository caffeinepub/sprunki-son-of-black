  "summary": "Diff implements a new global facility lighting preset in FacilityWorld, adjusts renderer tone mapping/exposure/background in GameView, and hardens overlays so Hood vignette is subtle and FadeToBlack is inactive unless explicitly activated. No clear BuildRequest requirements appear unimplemented based on the provided diff summary. Some non-requested project metadata/docs files were also modified.",
