  "summary": "REQ-16 is partially implemented: GameView renderer/tone-mapping exposure and a fullscreen, no-scroll container are updated, FacilityWorld lighting/material visibility is increased, and the hood vignette overlay is made more subtle. However, the diff summary does not provide direct evidence that the fade-to-black overlay is disabled by default and does not render/affect visibility when inactive (the relevant HudShell changes are only mentioned in a summary file, not shown as a code diff).",

      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Ensure UI overlays (especially fade-to-black) do not fully obscure the scene unless explicitly triggered; fade-to-black is not active by default and when inactive it does not render or affect scene visibility.",
      "reason": "No code diff is shown for the component that controls the fade-to-black overlay state/rendering (e.g., HudShell/Fade overlay). The only mention is in a text summary file, which is not sufficient evidence of implementation.",
