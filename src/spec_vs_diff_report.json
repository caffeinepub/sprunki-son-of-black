  "summary": "REQ-13 and REQ-14 appear implemented. The diff adds Three.js/R3F renderer and scene configuration (tone mapping, exposure, color space, dark background) and rebalances/augments world lighting so the facility geometry is visible while staying dark. It also ensures overlays (hood vignette and fade-to-black) do not black out gameplay by default: the vignette opacity is reduced and FadeToBlack defaults to inactive and is not rendered when inactive.",
