      "text": "Make the 3D game map (React Three Fiber Canvas) render fullscreen by ensuring the GameView container fills the viewport (width and height) and the app root elements (html/body/#root) allow 100% height without introducing scrollbars.",

        "On desktop and mobile, the 3D scene fills the entire visible viewport (no letterboxing caused by container sizing).",
        "No page scrollbars appear during normal gameplay due to layout sizing (unless intentionally added elsewhere).",

    "Do not edit files under frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts, frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.tsx, frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts, frontend/src/main.tsx, or anything under frontend/src/components/ui (immutable paths).",
    "Keep the backend as a single Motoko actor; no backend changes are required for this request."

  "nonGoals": [
    "Do not change scene lighting, tone mapping, or world layout as part of this fullscreen change.",
    "Do not add new gameplay features, scenes, or UI panels beyond what is needed to support fullscreen rendering."
